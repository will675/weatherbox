# Icon Mapping: Met Office Weather Types to 8×8 LED Matrix Icons
#
# This file maps Met Office weather type codes to icon IDs from led8x8icons.py.
# Each entry defines what icon (as bitmap index) to display for a given weather condition.
#
# Met Office weather types (from API weather_type field):
#   0: Clear night, 1: Sunny day, 2: Partly cloudy (night), 3: Partly cloudy (day),
#   4: Not used, 5: Mist, 6: Fog, 7: Cloudy, 8: Overcast, 9: Light rain,
#   10: Light rain (night), 11: Drizzle, 12: Light snow, 13: Light rain + snow,
#   14: Partly cloudy + light rain, 15: Partly cloudy + light snow, 16: Partly cloudy + light rain + snow,
#   17: Yellow warning (wind), 18: Orange warning (wind), 19: Red warning (wind),
#   20: Yellow warning (snow), etc.

# Default/Fallback mappings
# (These are the most common conditions and should match icons in led8x8icons.py)

# Clear/Sunny Conditions
0: 0     # Clear night → Clear icon (0)
1: 1     # Sunny day → Sun icon (1)

# Partly Cloudy
2: 2     # Partly cloudy (night) → Cloud+star icon (2)
3: 3     # Partly cloudy (day) → Cloud+sun icon (3)

# Cloud conditions
5: 4     # Mist → Mist/fog icon (4)
6: 4     # Fog → Mist/fog icon (4)
7: 5     # Cloudy → Cloud icon (5)
8: 5     # Overcast → Cloud icon (5)

# Precipitation
9: 6     # Light rain → Rain icon (6)
10: 6    # Light rain (night) → Rain icon (6)
11: 6    # Drizzle → Rain icon (6)
12: 7    # Light snow → Snow icon (7)
13: 8    # Light rain + snow → Sleet icon (8)
14: 6    # Partly cloudy + light rain → Rain icon (6)
15: 7    # Partly cloudy + light snow → Snow icon (7)
16: 8    # Partly cloudy + light rain + snow → Sleet icon (8)

# Warnings
17: 9    # Yellow warning (wind) → Warning icon (9)
18: 9    # Orange warning (wind) → Warning icon (9)
19: 9    # Red warning (wind) → Warning icon (9)
20: 10   # Yellow warning (snow) → Snow warning icon (10)

# Fallback: Any unmapped weather type will use icon 0 (clear icon)
# To debug unmapped types, enable verbose_api_logging in config.yaml

# Icon Reference (must match led8x8icons.py):
# 0: Clear/Checkmark pattern
# 1: Sun pattern
# 2: Cloud with star pattern
# 3: Cloud with sun pattern
# 4: Mist/fog pattern
# 5: Cloud pattern
# 6: Rain drops pattern
# 7: Snow flakes pattern
# 8: Sleet pattern (rain + snow)
# 9: Warning/exclamation pattern
# 10: Snow warning pattern
#
# To verify available icon IDs:
#   python3 -c "from led8x8icons import ICONS; print(list(ICONS.keys()))"
